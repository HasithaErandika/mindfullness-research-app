# Research Methodology

## Data Collection Process
1. **Daily Engagement**: Participants complete daily slider assessments
2. **Weekly Reflection**: Participants answer weekly thought-provoking questions
3. **Periodic Assessment**: Participants complete comprehensive questionnaires
4. **Behavioral Tracking**: App tracks engagement patterns and consistency

## Experimental Design
- **Control Group**: Standard mindfulness tracking features
- **Experimental Group**: Enhanced features with additional interventions
- **Blinded Assignment**: Participants unaware of group assignment
- **Longitudinal Study**: 6-month data collection period

## Psychological Scales Used

### Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
The PSS is a psychological instrument that measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The 10-item version used in this study includes:
- Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Never, 4 = Very Often)
- Higher scores indicate higher perceived stress
- Validated for research use in diverse populations

### Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)
The FFMQ assesses multiple aspects of mindfulness:
- **Observing**: Notice/attend to sights, sounds, sensations
- **Describing**: Put experiences into words
- **Acting with Awareness**: Attend to activities of the present moment
- **Non-Judging of Inner Experience**: Take a non-evaluative stance toward thoughts and feelings
- **Non-Reactivity to Inner Experience**: Allow thoughts and feelings to come and go without getting caught up in them

Each facet contains 3 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Never or Very Rarely True, 5 = Very Often or Always True).

## Vocal Biomarker Analysis
As part of the research methodology, vocal biomarkers are collected to:
- Assess acoustic features related to stress and emotional states
- Provide objective physiological data complementing self-reported measures
- Enable longitudinal tracking of vocal patterns throughout the study period

### Data Collection Protocol
1. Participants read a standardized passage aloud
2. Audio is recorded in WAV format with quality settings ensuring research-grade audio
3. Recordings are between 15-45 seconds in duration
4. Files are securely uploaded to Cloudflare R2 storage
5. Metadata is stored in the database linking recordings to questionnaire responses

### Analysis Framework
Vocal biomarker analysis includes examination of:
- Fundamental frequency (pitch) variations
- Spectral characteristics (formants, spectral tilt)
- Temporal features (speech rate, pauses)
- Prosodic features (intonation, rhythm)
- Voice quality measures (jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio)
